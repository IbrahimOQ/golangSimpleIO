#### **golangSimpleIO (version: 1.0.0)**


###### This Go package provides a straightforward way to read messages from socket connections and command line interface. It also provides functions for writing to consoles and socket connections.

#### **Reading from Connection**


###### input, response := io.ConnRead (connRes, "\n")

###### Reading from a network connection requires a connection resource.
###### It can be provided by some procedures like net.Dial (...).

###### "ConnRead" also optionally requires a delimiter, as a string. If no delimiter is provided, "\n" will be used.

###### The procedure returns two data. The first one is the input taken.
###### The second is an error concerning the input process.
###### If there is no error, nothing will be provided.

###### Providing a string that can not be found in a message received, will help return the whole message, once the connection is closed by the other-party.

###### input, response := io.ConnRead (connRes, "!end")

###### Assuming a connection is to an HTTP server, the example above will return the full HTTP response, once the connection is closed by the server.

#### **Writing to Connection**


###### io.ConnWrite (connRes, "This is some message")

###### Writing to a network connection requires a connection resource and a message to be sent.
###### Connection resource can be provided by some procedures like net.Dial (...).

###### This function is based on fmt.FPrintf (), and was provided for programmers who desire all-in-one.

#### **Reading from Console**


###### input, response := io.ConsoleRead ("\n", "Some input: ")

###### "ConsoleRead" requires at least one parameter. The first is a single-character string that will mark the end of an input process.
###### The second parameter is what should be displayed as label when trying to take input from the console.
###### If a label is not needed, this parameter can be omitted

###### The procedure returns two data. The first one is the input taken. The second is an error concerning the input process.
###### If there is no error, nothing will be provided.

#### **Writing to Console**


###### io.ConsoleWrite ("Hello world!", "\n", "This is Golang")

###### "ConsoleWrite" allows writing of multiple strings to the console, in one call.
###### It is based on fmt.Println ().
